Ideally to build all across series of Ubuntu release, we can base on these
configurations as seen in this repository then do a text substition for target
Ubuntu series to release to, integrate/setup with automated build and that's it.

As face value, this whole repository targets on Focal which is the main development
machine I'm using.

You can manually visit my PPA to explore packages I've published on there so it
will be ease in installation and using on your side at https://launchpad.net/~haxpor.

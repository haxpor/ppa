Ideally to build all across series of Ubuntu release, we can base on these
configurations as seen in this repository then do a text substition for target
Ubuntu series to release to, integrate/setup with automated build and that's it.

As face value, this whole repository targets on Focal which is the main development
machine I'm using.
